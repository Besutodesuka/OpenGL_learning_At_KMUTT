# Credit 
this repository is part of CPE494 course about 3D game development using C and opengl. in this course we use ample code from
Learn OpenGL repository and [https://learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com). make sure to check it out.
thankyou for such good resource help us learning things from scartch step by step.

# Repository structure
for easier compiling code, I use same project directory and cmak configuration as learn opengl repository. some of my project are modified from the original course to create what I have in my imagination. for readability I will provide modified code in work_collection folder and place README.md file for explaination in each project. you can checkout link to those folder below.
